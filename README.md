## ‚ú® Project Overview
This solo project consists of three command-line Node.js applications:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors** ‚Äì A terminal game where you play against the computer.
2. **Pig Latin Translator** ‚Äì Translates English phrases to Pig Latin based on simple linguistic rules.
3. **Caesar Cipher** ‚Äì Encrypts a phrase using the Caesar cipher method with positive or negative shifts.

## üìÜ Duration
- **Full Time**: 5 Days

## üöÄ Requirements Summary
### FR001 ‚Äì Solo Project
You must work independently. Collaboration is not allowed.

### FR002 ‚Äì Public GitHub Repository
- Keep the repository public.
- Do not add instructors as collaborators.

### FR003 ‚Äì Incremental Development
- All updates to the `main` branch must be done via Pull Requests only.

### FR004 ‚Äì Presentation
- Present the code to your peers and instructor.
- Walk through your code **line by line**.

### FR005 ‚Äì Rock Paper Scissors
- Input: `process.argv` (e.g., `node rockPaperScissors.js rock`)
- The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors
- Output result: win, lose, or draw

### FR006 ‚Äì Pig Latin Translator
- Input: `process.argv` (e.g., `node pigLatin.js "Pig Latin is fun"`)
- Converts each word based on rules:
  - Starts with vowel ‚Üí add "way"
  - Starts with consonant + vowel ‚Üí move first letter to end + "ay"
  - Starts with 2 consonants ‚Üí move both to end + "ay"

### FR007 ‚Äì Caesar Cipher
- Input: Phrase + Shift value from `process.argv`
- Output: Encrypted phrase
- Supports positive (right shift) and negative (left shift) values

## ‚úÖ Project Completion Checklist

All required exercises have been completed with guidance:

- [x] Rock Paper Scissors (FR005)
- [x] Pig Latin Translator (FR006)
- [x] Caesar Cipher (FR007)

> These exercises were completed with Online Searches and Articles, but every step was understood and implemented personally.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All work was completed on a single branch. Future projects will follow best practices by creating separate branches for each feature and merging them via Pull Requests.

## üß† Reflections & Notes

- Practiced advanced JavaScript string manipulation and logic  
- Learned about character codes and modular arithmetic (Caesar Cipher)  
- Explored different ways to loop and transform data (`forEach`, `map`)  
- Understood how to identify and handle user input from `process.argv`  
- Gained confidence in using regular expressions to detect letters
