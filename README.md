## âœ¨ Project Overview
This solo project consists of three command-line Node.js applications:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors** â€“ A terminal game where you play against the computer.
2. **Pig Latin Translator** â€“ Translates English phrases to Pig Latin based on simple linguistic rules.
3. **Caesar Cipher** â€“ Encrypts a phrase using the Caesar cipher method with positive or negative shifts.

## ðŸš€ Requirements Summary
### FR001 â€“ Solo Project
You must work independently. Collaboration is not allowed.

### FR002 â€“ Public GitHub Repository
- Keep the repository public.
- Do not add instructors as collaborators.

### FR003 â€“ Incremental Development
- All updates to the `main` branch must be done via Pull Requests only.

### FR004 â€“ Presentation
- Present the code to your peers and instructor.
- Walk through your code **line by line**.

### FR005 â€“ Rock Paper Scissors
- Input: `process.argv` (e.g., `node rockPaperScissors.js rock`)
- The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors
- Output result: win, lose, or draw

### FR006 â€“ Pig Latin Translator
- Input: `process.argv` (e.g., `node pigLatin.js "Pig Latin is fun"`)
